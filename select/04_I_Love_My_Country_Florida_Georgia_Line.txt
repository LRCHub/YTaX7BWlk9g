(Woo)
Yeah, baby

Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
Drop a deer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
How the good Lord intended it, yes he did

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hangin' out the window, like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country and I love my country up loud

(Woo)
Barbecue, steak fries
Styrofoam, plate date night
George Strait singing greats while
We turning up, sitting lakeside
That pedalsteel, she straight sliding
Over here, to me she do that
Alabama shake, like you ain't ever seen

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hangin' out the window, like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country and I love my country up loud

(Woo)
I love my country up loud
I'm talking way up loud

I like pop, and rock, and rap, I like Skynyrd
And goin' out downtown when I'm with her
Like drivin' too fast down a four lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hangin' out the window, like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country and I love my country up loud

Yeah, baby
(Woo)
I love my country up loud
Yeah, way up loud

That's a country-ass lyric right there, boy, haha, yee
